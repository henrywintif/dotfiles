# Henry's Dotfiles
## How-To: use with stow
### Init
1. clone into `~/workspace`.
2. `cd ~/workspace/dotfiles`
3. `stow . -t ~`

### Restow
Stow makes links from config locations to this directory. 
If you have stowed and then edit the files in this directory, no action is needed for the programs that rely on these config files to see the changes.
If, however, you add a new config file to this repo, it will not be added to your home folder.
To add it, you must "restow". The command to do this is:
`stow -R . -t ~`.
